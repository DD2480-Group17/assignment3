package org.terasology.recording;

/**
 * Stores the current RecordAndReplayStatus. This class is extremely important since the status is the flag that
 * activates Record and Replay.
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * &lt;h2&gt;Record Workflow&lt;h2/&gt; When the user clicks on the &quot;Record&quot; button on the extras menu, the {@link #status}
 * is set to PREPARING_RECORD. When a game is selected to be loaded from the &quot;Record Screen&quot; and the game is completely
 * loaded, the {@link #status} will be set to RECORDING by the {@link org.terasology.engine.modes.loadProcesses.InitialiseRecordAndReplay}
 * load process, which will make the {@link org.terasology.entitySystem.event.internal.EventSystemImpl} call the {@link EventCatcher}
 * every time an event is sent.
 *
 * The RECORDING status will also make the {@link DirectionAndOriginPosRecorder} and {@link CharacterStateEventPositionMap}
 * record the data they are supposed to. Every time the game is saved during the recording, {@link org.terasology.persistence.internal.SaveTransaction}'s
 * saveRecordingData() is called and the events in the {@link RecordedEventStore} are saved in an &quot;event file&quot;, reseting
 * the store and updating {@link RecordAndReplayUtils}.
 *
 * When the game shutdowns with the RECORDING status, the {@link RecordAndReplayUtils}'s shutdownRequested is set to true
 * and then every recorded  data that was not stored yet will be serialized and stored once {@link org.terasology.persistence.internal.SaveTransaction}'s
 * saveRecordingData() method is called right after the game is saved. Once this is done, the {@link #status} is set to NOT_ACTIVATED.
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * &lt;h2&gt;Replay Workflow&lt;h2/&gt; When the user clicks on the &quot;Replay&quot; button on the extras menu, the {@link #status}
 * is set to PREPEARING_REPLAY. During the load process of a Replay, the {@link org.terasology.engine.modes.loadProcesses.InitialiseWorld}
 * class gets the game path from the &quot;recordings&quot; folder instead of the &quot;saves&quot; one, and the {@link org.terasology.engine.bootstrap.EntitySystemSetupUtil}
 * creates an {@link EventSystemReplayImpl} instead of {@link org.terasology.entitySystem.event.internal.EventSystemImpl}.
 *
 * When the game is loading, the InitialiseRecordAndReplay load process will set the {@link #status} to REPLAYING and deserialize
 * the recorded data, updating {@link RecordedEventStore},{@link RecordAndReplayUtils}, {@link CharacterStateEventPositionMap}
 * and {@link DirectionAndOriginPosRecorderList}.
 *
 * With the game loaded and the {@link #status} as REPLAYING, the {@link EventSystemReplayImpl} will load the events from the
 * {@link RecordedEventStore} and play them according to the timestamp, while blocking these events from being sent normally
 * by the user. When the event system replays every event in the store, it checks to see if there are more &quot;event files&quot;.
 * If there are, the store is updated and the event system continues to replay the events. It is important to notice that
 * the REPLAYING status also makes the {@link DirectionAndOriginPosRecorderList} and {@link CharacterStateEventPositionMap}
 * to replace some variables for the recorded ones. Once there is no more events to be replayed, the {@link #status} is set to
 * REPLAY_FINISHED and the {@link EventSystemReplayImpl} will work exactly like {@link org.terasology.entitySystem.event.internal.EventSystemImpl}.
 *
 * When the game is shutdown during this state, {@link RecordAndReplayUtils}'s shutdownRequested variable is set to true,
 * and then when {@link org.terasology.persistence.internal.SaveTransaction}'s run() method is called, the {@link #status} will be
 * set to NOT_ACTIVATED and the {@link RecordAndReplayUtils} will be reset. It is important to know that during the
 * REPLAYING and REPLAY_FINISHED state the game is not saved since this is blocked by those statuses.

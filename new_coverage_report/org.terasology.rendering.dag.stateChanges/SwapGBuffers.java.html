/**
 * This StateChange is used to swap the lastUpdated and the stale FBOs in the gBufferPair.
 *
 * This is useful for Nodes that want to do rendering operations requiring the latest content stored in the
 * gBufferPair, to be used as inputs for a shader.
 * For instance, once a node has read from the lastUpdatedGBuffer and written to the staleGBuffer,
 * it will probably want to swap the buffers so that the &quot;stale&quot; gBuffer becomes the &quot;lastUpdated&quot;
 * one and the next node can rely on it.
 * There can be exceptions though, as consecutive nodes might all write to the lastUpdatedGuffer, requiring no swaps.
 *
 * Note that this StateChange is special because unlike all the other StateChanges that modify the state of the
 * system during the execution of the task list, this StateChange does its job on construction and therefore
 * during the _generation_ of the task list.
 *
 * This is done by causing a change in the return value of gBufferPair.get*Buffer().
 * As a consequence this StateChange -must- be added after all calls to gBuferPair.get*Buffer() in the Node.
 *
 * Note that theoretically a very similar result could have been achieved with a method available to all rendering
 * nodes. However, a state change adds an item to the task list. This way when the task list is printed out for
 * debugging it's easy to see where the swap occurs.

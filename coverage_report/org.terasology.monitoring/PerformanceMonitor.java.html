    /**
     * Indicates the start of an activity. All started activities must either be ended with a call to endActivity()
     * (see example 1) or take advantage of the autocloseable interface implemented by Activity (see example 2).&lt;br&gt;
     * &lt;br&gt;
     *
     * Example 1 - explicitly ending an activity:
     * &lt;pre&gt;
     * PerformanceMonitor.startActivity(&quot;myActivity&quot;)
     * doSomething();
     * PerformanceMonitor.endActivity()
     * &lt;/pre&gt;
     *
     * Example 2 - the end of the activity is handled internally:
     * &lt;pre&gt;
     * try (Activity ignored = PerformanceMonitor.startActivity(&quot;myActivity&quot;) {
     *     doSomething();
     * }
     * &lt;/pre&gt;
     *
     * The latter case is particularly useful whenever the activity's code has a number of possible exit paths,
     * as it might be undesirable or simply non-trivial to add an endActivity() call at the end of each.&lt;br&gt;
     * &lt;br&gt;
     *
     * Activities may be nested. Example: (the indentation pattern is not strictly necessary)
     * &lt;pre&gt;
     * PerformanceMonitor.startActivity(&quot;myActivity&quot;)
     * doSomething();
     *
     *     PerformanceMonitor.startActivity(&quot;myNestedActivity&quot;)
